## Contents of the module

- Real-life data analysis always involves data management 
- Introducing some new techniques and software, especially the [*tidyverse*](https://www.tidyverse.org/) framework in R 
- Some basic programming in R
- We will not learn new statistical methods 
- Prereqs: SOC1004/POL1008, SOC/POL1041, and SOC/POL2077

## What you know already

- SOC1004/POL1008: basic descriptive statistics, visualizations and R
- SOC/POL1041: statistical inference and hypothesis testing
- SOC/POL2077: linear (regression) model

## How you can benefit from this module

- In most workplaces you won't have to do complex statistical analysis 
- Often what you do is a relatively technically simple analysis with 'dirty' data
- Another important skill is how to effectively present statistical analysis to people much statistical background
- Applications: market research, policy analysis, business intelligence, data journalism, etc.
- This should be helpful for your dissertations as well

## Lecturer

- Dr Alexey Bessudnov (http://abessudnov.net/)
- Teaching assistant: Yiyang Gao

## Topics

- Reproducible research: Git, Github and R Markdown
- Data structures and types in R
- Manipulating data: the *dplyr* package
- Reshaping longitudinal data: the *tidyr* package
- Visualising data with the *ggplot2* package
- Control structures and loops in R
- Writing functions in R

## What you should be able to do after you complete this module

- Acquire more fluency with R
- Analyse large and complex data sets in R
- Efficiently organise the data analysis workflow

## Practical arrangements

- Classes: Wednesday, 9.30-11.30am (Queens LT4.2)
- Office hours (Clayden 1.05): Monday, 10-11am; Friday, 10-11am
- Yiyang's office hours: Clayden, Wednesday, 11.30am-1.30pm
- Class attendance: mandatory

## Assessment: Statistical assignments

- 50% of the final mark: 5 statistical assignments, 10% each
- Statistical assignments will be R exercises
- Deadlines: 28 January (test, does not count for the final mark), 4 February, 11 February, 18 February, 3 March, 17 March
- Exercises will be released a week before the deadline
- Assignments will be submitted both on Github (using Github Classroom) and Bart 
- IPL students: the maximum extension length is one week; after this you will need to contact me asap and I will give you a new assignment

## Assessment: Statistical report

- 50% of the final mark: statistical report (2,000 words)
- This will be a report with the results of independent longitudinal data analysis you will conduct with the Understanding Society data
- Deadline: 28 April
- I will communicate to you details about the report in February / early March
- Marks and feedback will be released by 12 June
- Please see the marking criteria in the module outline

##  "Flipped classroom"

- "Flipped classroom" is a pedagogical technique
- It is impossible to teach data analysis; you can only learn it yourself
- You read new material and do exercises at home before the class
- In class we discuss it together, I answer questions, give you more exercises, etc.

 
##  Resources

- Module Github repo: https://github.com/datan3-2020/datan3 (forked from the repo for the last year)
- Module website: http://abessudnov.net/dataanalysis3/ (note that this accompanied the module in 2018 and this year some things will change)
- Main text: G.Grolemund & H.Wickham. R for Data Science. Available online
at http://r4ds.had.co.nz/.
- Some other readings are in the module outline

## Module workflow

- All class notes and syntax files will be posted on https://github.com/datan3-2020/datan3
- There will be a separate repository for each statistical assignment and I will explain later how you complete and submit assignments

##  Git

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a version control software
- It is mostly used by software developers, but can be applied to other projects as well
- Please see the ProGit book (https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2), althout it is too detailed for our needs
- We will use Git in combination with Github and R Studio
- More details here: J.Bryant et al. [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](https://happygitwithr.com/).

## Github

- Github is a website where developers keep their code and collaborate
- It is very popular among developers and it is increasingly used by social science researchers
- It is good for you to know this tool
- We will use [Github Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/) to organise submission and marking of assignments (please watch the videos on that website)
- Let's explore https://github.com/datan3-2020/datan3

## Exercise 1

- Go to https://github.com/ and register your account. Please use your university email address (in the format ab789@exeter.ac.uk)
- Before you do this you will need to have Git installed on your computer: https://git-scm.com/
- Once you have created your Github account please fork this repo: https://github.com/datan3-2020/datan3
- Note that your fork will be public. If you want a private repo just create a new one
- After this create a project in R Studio by cloning your Github repo

## Data

- In this module we will use the data from the [Understanding Society](https://www.understandingsociety.ac.uk/), a household longitudinal survey conducted in the UK
- The main reason for this is that this data set has a particularly complex structure
- You have read a paper introducing the Understanding Society for today's class
- The data are released via the UK Data Service (study number 6614): https://beta.ukdataservice.ac.uk/datacatalogue/studies/study?id=6614

## Data access

- You will need to register an account on the UK Data Service
- Then you will need to download the data (SN6614) in the TAB format. It is a zip archive that you will need to extract and put in the *data* folder in your module project
- If you do everything correctly then in your **data** folder you will have the folder **UKDA-6614-tab**

## .gitignore file

- You don't want the Understanding Society data to be synched to Github (it violates the agreement with the data provider and it is too large)
- Maybe you will want to keep some other files in your project private as well
- You can keep some files private by editing the *.gitignore* file in your project
- Please edit your *.gitignore* file and add the line "data/"
- You can add other files and folder to *.gitignore* as well, please see https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/saving-changes/gitignore

## For the next class (22 Jan)

- Update your R and R Studio distributions
- Install Git: https://git-scm.com/
- Register an account on Github: https://github.com/
- Register an account on the UK Data Service website and download the Understanding Society full data (study 6614): https://beta.ukdataservice.ac.uk/datacatalogue/studies/study?id=6614
- Read N.Buck \& S.McFall. (2011). "Understanding Society: design overview": http://llcsjournal.org/index.php/llcs/article/viewFile/159/168
- Read ch.1 and 2 from R Markdown: The Definitive Guide: https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/
